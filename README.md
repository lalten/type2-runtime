# type2-runtime ![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

The runtime is the executable part of every AppImage. It mounts the payload via FUSE and executes the entrypoint.

This repository builds a statically linked runtime for type-2 AppImages in a [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) chroot with [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/).

Since the runtime is linked statically, libfuse2 is no longer required on the target system.

## Notes for users

As an AppImage user, you do not need this repository, as the AppImage runtime is embedded into every AppImage.

## Notes for developers

__Please note:__ This repository is meant to be extremely simple.

* Do NOT add additional external dependencies or files. Everything shall be implemented in one file. `runtime.c`  

Binaries are provided on GitHub Releases. To build the runtime yourself, run:
```
docker run -it --rm --volume `pwd`:/workdir alpine:latest /workdir/build.sh
```

This whole process takes only a few seconds, e.g., on GitHub Codespaces.
